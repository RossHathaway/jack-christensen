    under. There can be more than one url. If you want to view or edit the list of
    url sections, click on the list item(s) below (there is no name shown on the item(s)).
    This will display the list of url sections. You can add or edit url sections to
    the list. <br><br>For example, for a document in the Frank Lloyd Wright folder,
    you might want it to be listed under featured/frank-lloyd-wright/document-name
    as well as content/architecture/document-name. This means you would add two lists
    here. Each list would have two sections: "Featured" and "Frank Lloyd Wright" in
    one list, and "Content" and "Architecture" in the other.<br><br>If you want to
    create a new category, just list it here and it will be created in the site''s
    menu.'
