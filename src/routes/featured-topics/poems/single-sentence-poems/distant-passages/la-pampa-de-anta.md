### La Pampa de Anta 
Yesterday's weather left watermarks <br />
darkly down the rugged adobe wall <br />
that enshadows a still-muddy road <br />
where a dog with a mottled coat <br />
lies asleep beneath a Saybo tree, <br />
its muzzle pointing into the wind <br />
scented by wet soil, from fields <br />

of potato plants neatly cultivated <br />
in low lanes which sway and ripple

with fluttering leaves of rich green, <br />
highlighted by wildly bobbing dots of <br />
vibrant white and violet-hued blossoms, <br />
but now this pleasant vista is disturbed <br />
by hissing air brakes and the skidding, <br />
squishing tires of a delivery truck

from the limestone fertilizer factory <br />
at Cachimayo -- as the alert driver <br />
stops to avert hitting a skinny kid <br />
trying to ride a dilapidated bike -- <br />
these noises awakening the shaggy dog <br />
that scampers off, around the corner <br />
of a new building with its prominent <br />
roadside face recently emblazoned by <br />
yet another of the multitudinous signs <br />
blatantly advertising COLA drinks --<br />
a visual bane and nationwide blight.
