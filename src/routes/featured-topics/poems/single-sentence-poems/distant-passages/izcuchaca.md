### Izcuchaca 
Passing through this Peruvian <br />
mountain town, I momentarily <br />
glimpse a typical village lad <br />
sitting on a plank bridge <br />
with his bare feet dangling <br />
over a silt-filled stream, <br />
who eats an ear of tan corn <br />
with ocher-colored speckles, <br />
and the boy's dusky skin

and his monotone clothes <br />
and those worn boards <br />
and that flowing water <br />
are all the same shade <br />
of tarnished copper <br />
which pervades this <br />
Andean farming area.
