## The Sacred Valley Of The Incas 
Happily chattering women and girls <br />
carry loaded laundry baskets up the <br />
grassy bank of the Urubamba River, <br />
and after reaching level land they <br />
set the heavy burdens down, then <br />
begin flapping and spreading their <br />
saturated fabrics over the branches <br />
of a cactus hedge, its thick pads <br />
entirely covered by sturdy spikes <br />
which pin the cloth securely in <br />
place, creating a shapeless and <br />
fantastic patchwork of abstract, <br />
multicolored mounds that remain <br />
unmoved by buffeting breezes.
