### Miyajima 
To see the famous view, we rented a skiff <br />
and rowed away from the Sacred Island of <br />
steep ravines safeguarded by evergreens, <br />
out to The Great Gateway with wing-like <br />
crossbeams atop two tall pillars hewn <br />
from the trunks of single trees painted <br />
vermilion and placed adjacent to the <br />
seashore's "floating" Shinto Shrine that <br />
now seemed to be rising upon its pilings <br />
as the tide subsided, and here we let

our skiff drift in shallow water while <br />
we ate big blue grapes from a paper bag, <br />
also noticing a large deer crowned with <br />
stumps of sawed-off antlers, wading our <br />
way from a cove and presently placing <br />
his head into the boat, brazenly tame, <br />
receiving from us a few cordial pats -- <br />
­when suddenly that fat stag's yellow <br />
teeth started ripping our bag apart -- <br />
­so we fed him enough grapes to satisfy his <br />
stubborn voracity and skiff-rocking <br />
persistence until we finished the bunch, <br />
whereupon our obstreperous guest quickly <br />
nabbed the bag and turned shoreward -­- <br />
still chewing on the remaining stems <br />
and paper stained with grape juice.
