## Machu Picchu 
As I hiked along an ancient passage <br />
overlooking a plunging jungle ravine, <br />
not far from the architectural wonders <br />
constructed atop ingeniously engineered <br />
terraces supporting edifices of immense <br />
proportions, all connected by tiers of <br />
narrow stairways -- these colossal ruins

now overrun by a midday invasion of groups <br />
brought on the tourist train from Cuzco -Â­I <br />
came alone to a wayside boulder shaped <br />
like an Inca throne, suggesting I sit

and preside over this undisturbed site, <br />
but I quickly relinquished my intention <br />
of occupying that splendid seat -- <br />
just then preempted by a black snake.
