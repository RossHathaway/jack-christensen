When Japanese people take long rides on trains, their usual pastimes are eating, drinking and intently operating some electronic device. Instead of that, my <u>artistic mysticism</u> keeps me looking out the window and being keenly observant of whatever comes into view, concentrating on entering the <u>mystical environment</u> experienced by Vincent van Gogh -- through acute attentiveness to the various relationships of areas and forms, the details of patterns and textures, and the multiplicity of light and shadow and color.

The True Human Movement
Originally envisioned at dawn on September 19, 1977
along the west bank of the Kamo River in Kyoto
</div>

The True Human Movement is <u>self-transcendence</u>, a progression through incremental <u>individuation</u>, which is also the dynamic basis of Evolutionary Existentialism and the impelling factor of Jiriki Zen. One's gradual self-improvement has no ultimate culmination beyond perpetually actuating <u>self-transcendence</u>.
Thus, a True Human is never a finished product.

Jiriki Zen is a mystical religion that goes past sectarian Buddhism, from which you create some personal rituals for daily refinement as your <u>continuing</u> Enlightenment. You seek nothing in addition to these private practices. There isn't anything greater to expect, no special revelation or more sacred place anywhere -- because none is needed. Your own observations are instruments for independently discerning your <u>path that is no path</u>. The epigram, "You cannot follow The Path Of Enlightenment until you have become the path" indicates that it is not a path <u>to</u> awareness but a way <u>of</u> awareness, so never think about going <u>toward</u> Enlightenment somewhere out there. Just venture <u>within</u> your psyche -- where it already resides. However, this inner Jiriki Zen also entails your constantly responding to the world, but without becoming submerged in it or wasting mental energy on emphatic reactions from one's ego-personality. You must always immediately pause to reconsider any outburst of your <u>primal responsive consciousness</u> that disrupts your steadfast Quadratic Balance: physical-emotional-rational-mystical.

<strong>JUST BEING IN JAPAN</strong> is itself an invitation to the exercise of <u>artistic mysticism</u> which encourages you to USE artworks and beautiful environments, rather than merely looking at them. Enjoy finding and frequenting some special places and things you can USE as gateways into The Mystical Frontier.

Here-and-there you now-and-then will encounter this-and-that, which somehow function as Unique Beacons, Aesthetic Messengers, suggestive thresholds, possible guideposts, hints, clues -- leading to and furthering your mystical <u>path that is no path</u>.

"Wisdom Sits In Places" so maintain an alertness for your own <u>inaugural spots</u> in certain locations that seem to harbor subtle affinities or perhaps <u>symbolic embodiments</u>. After you discover such sites, keep returning to them, and if you find yourself lapsing into dull inadvertence while merely basking in their pleasant atmosphere, immediately snap out of it -- or you're apt to miss significant <u>momentary manifestations</u>.

WATCH FOR OLD SHINBOKU, NEWLY SEEN AS COSMIC EMBLEMS:
The word <u>shinboku</u> from the endemic Japanese Shinto Religion
translates as "sacred tree" and the term <u>iwakura</u> stands for
"the abode of a spirit" which can be any extraordinary tree, rock, waterfall, pond or natural setting with an enigmatic quality. But in today's Postanimistic Age (brought about by the globalization of civilization, through our scientific advancements that are linking humankind everywhere into technological accord) such things as <u>shinboku</u> and <u>iwakura</u> now can be seen in a universal sense as Cosmic Emblems. For this is how they function in our present Postanimistic Age and the way they should be understood. According to analytical <u>neologists</u>, we have surpassed antiquated terms reflecting outdated assumptions about "invisible spirits" or "guardians" or "eternal souls." These popular concepts are perpetuated by a lingering social receptivity to an obsessive <u>theoretical animism</u> in its most familiar forms: folklore, superstition, sentimentality and various types
of vague "spirituality." Science has transcended these tedious ideas and become <u>antianimistic</u>. Most scholars who are <u>free thinkers</u> join the ranks of nonaggressive antianimists. Nonetheless, a prevalence of established animistic sites in Japan makes this particular nation an excellent place for us to see the transformation of traditional Shinto <u>shinboku</u> and <u>iwakura</u> into profound Cosmic Emblems transparent to <u>an astronomical viewpoint</u> toward The Cosmic Singularity.
