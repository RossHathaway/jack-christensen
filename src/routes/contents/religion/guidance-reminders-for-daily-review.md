<h2>GUIDANCE REMINDERS FOR DAILY REVIEW</h2> 

<blockquote> All life is bound to individual carriers who manifest it, and life is simply inconceivable without them.
-- Carl Jung
</blockquote>

Temporarily Stabilized Phenomena: Everything is real but transitory, while impermanence itself must be recognized as the only absolute certainty. Humankind and enormous populations of other common creatures now on Earth are undeniably approaching annihilation during our planet's impending Sixth Mass Extinction accelerated by ourselves.

Our Double Life is a duality of two alternating personal perspectives: the reach of one's pitiful individuality, also the vast magnitude of <u>an astronomical viewpoint</u>.

You experience your lifetime through your unmatched psyche with its <u>primal responsive consciousness</u> that constantly engenders your unique ego-personality. The extent of your <u>responsiveness</u> sets the limits of your potentialities.

Entrust yourself entirely to guidance emerging spontaneously from your Wisdom Twin: one's innate Mystical Impulse together with your Ancestral Forenature.

Evolutionary Existentialism is a philosophy that ranks people according to these five basic categories of social behavior:
<u>True Human</u> or a case of <u>arrested development</u> or a <u>dullard</u> or <u>wastrel</u> or merely <u>nuisance vermin</u>.

When somebody's facial expression projects clearly their burden of a <u>discontented disposition</u>, you can counteract that unpleasant attitude being shown to you, if you will try to visualize this face as though it were radiating the <u>everlasting cheerfulness</u> of a True Human.

THESE THREE THINGS stand as validations of your personal participation in The True Human Movement: keeping your Quadratic Balance (physical-emotional-rational-mystical), practicing your Entirely Private Religious Rituals every day without fail, pursuing <u>a productive longevity</u>.

THE ESSENTIAL TASK OF A TRUE HUMAN is for us to interact symbiotically and aesthetically with our local environment, the larger political environment, the global environment and the unlimited astronomical environment engulfing us.

A TRUE HUMAN WORKDAY entails absolute dedication to one's endeavors, when we know intuitively that our efforts are necessary not only to oneself but inextricably woven into the significant achievements and aspirations of humankind.

<strong>The Best Use Of Your Time</strong> promises a <u>harvest</u> perhaps greater than anything you've imagined or planned or anticipated. So diminish thinking about the attainment of long term goals. Simply <u>stay current</u> by frequently reorganizing and revising your <u>priority lists</u> for upholding a daily schedule which is both practicable and comfortable -- while remaining confident that your "all-important mission in life" (your true <u>dharma</u>) is just the next thing you need to do.

As long as the water mill keeps on working, it does not freeze.

It's what you do every day that matters, not what you might do occasionally.

<blockquote>Ask yourself whether your action would be beautiful or ugly, rather than good or bad. -- Ernest Renan</blockquote>

You can make your life as ugly as you want it to be.

One's pioneering in The Mystical Frontier starts with <u>unlearning</u> and <u>brain flushing</u>, then leads to personal behavior modification and beneficial habit formation. Three related methods to employ are <u>chant walking</u> and <u>cursive handwriting practice</u> and <u>artistic mysticism</u>, equally effective for Emancipation Of Consciousness from your <u>primal responsive consciousness</u> and society's slave mentality and dead end delusions and religious stagnation.

Periods of chant walking and sessions of cursive handwriting practice are effective only when conducted on a daily basis, as ways to inform your multifunctional psyche of certain things your conscious mind considers of paramount importance to you. Keep repeating such ideas to the interconnected array of your mental powers with their capacity to coordinate guidelines and insights that come into your mind as you continue experimenting with <u>artistic mysticism</u>.

Those three easy activities harness the natural force of your psyche's <u>primal responsive consciousness</u>, diverting its energy toward your further development of <u>an astronomical viewpoint</u>, as you venture beyond the reach of your pitiful individuality and occasionally catch glimpses into infinitude -- momentarily experiencing your full participation in The Cosmic Singularity which can be described only as The Grand Unknown.
