EACH HIGHLY INFORMATIVE EXCURSION is escorted personally by

"Uncle Jack" Christensen who resided in this neighborhood

during the decade of the 1970s when Barack Obama lived here,

an area familiar to your guide since the mid-1950s. It's a

retrospective glimpse into the "Honolulu years" of Obama.

THE 90-MINUTE TOUR originated in October, 2008 at the height

of the Presidential Campaign and continues to be conducted

privately as the sole “on the spot" review of sites connected

with the Honolulu residency of the most famous person born

in Hawai'i who became our Nation's 44th Commander In Chief.

ACCURATE BACKGROUND FACTS are narrated chronologically at

certain sites in the Punahou and Pawa'a and Makiki districts

which formed the Hawai'i nei (immediate limited environment)

of “Barry" Obama, as he was known in his teen-age years.

SEE THE HOSPITAL where Barack Hussein Obama, Jr. came into

the world on August 4, 1961 (exact structure demolished 2016)

and the apartment building where he stayed with his maternal

grandparents during much of the time he attend Punahou School.

A short block away from its beautiful campus there's a smaller

apartment unit where "Barry" lived for three years with his

mother and half sister, Maya, who is ten years younger. Our

outing also goes past a small Baskin-Robbins store where Obama

worked part-time, and we pause beside outdoor basketball courts

at Washington Public School where he sometimes practiced his

favorite sport.

OF COURSE many features of the area have changed since young

"Barry" departed in 1979 to pursue his higher education and

amazing career. However, much remains the same as when it

was the hometown of the now internationally known personage

and recipient of Sweden's Nobel Prize who is often welcomed

as "global royalty" wherever he travels -- in recognition

of his many personal achievements.
