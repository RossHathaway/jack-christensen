"USING HAWAIIAN WORDS"'

FREE LECTURE PRESENTED BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT
FOR
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS
BUSINESS GROUPS

0 O O 0

THIS HELPFUL SESSION has been conducted by volunteer speakers
since April, 1974 as the easiest and fastest way to find out

how to cope with saying and writing individual Hawaiian words.
It's complete in a single sitting that lasts just one hour —-

not a series of classes for learning conversational Hawaiian.

The informal lecture ranks as the first and still the foremost
presentation of its kind for the general public, explaining
the structure of our Hawaiian place names in the Aloha State
and encouraging people to preserve them in speech and printed matter for generations to come.

Participants become acquainted with all the basic guidelines
for standard spelling, pronunciation and usage of traditional

terms people encounter everywhere throughout The Islands.

Such knowledge is essential for professionals who use Hawaiian
words frequently —- especially persons employed in the visitor
industry, public relations, advertising, writers and editors,

broadcasters and recording artists.

BACKGROUND

FOR OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY volunteer speakers contributed
hundreds of hours toward the development of this presentation.
At the outset, 1974—1977, different explanations and examples
were tested, evaluated and revised by lecturers who continually
refined their material while carefully retaining its informal
style and reliable content.

Those pioneering efforts were given without an admission charge
to more than eighty audiences at the following locations:

ADVISORY

PLEASE UNDERSTAND that sessions of Using Hawaiian WOrds are
conducted by volunteer speakers without a vast knowledge of
the Hawaiian Language. Ability in conversational Hawaiian is
not required because our primary goal is simply to cover the
basic guidelines of how to write and say individual Hawaiian
words. Your presenter will be following a standard procedure,
step-by—step, without departing from what we've learned works
best, from our experience before thousands of listeners. So
please refrain from interrupting the speaker to ask questions
that may come to mind —- because every question which occurs
to you probably will be answered when we reach the point where
that material is illustrated best in its relationship to other
fundamental factors. Thus, all the essentials can be covered
within the time limitation for this single session, and nOne
of the key elements will be left out.

 

LEARNING WORDS ONE—BY-ONE ON YOUR OWN

SINGLE TERMS or simple combinations of words comprise most of
the Hawaiian Language the average person is apt to encounter
throughout the major islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago where
about eighty—five percent of the place names are traditional
ones which many people consider Fiftieth State Treasures.

Hawaiian place names have beautifully melodious sounds when
they're pronounced accurately. But unfortunately we have
two prevalent problems regarding Hawaiian terms here in
Alohaland —— mispronunciation and careless typography.

Newcomers arrive daily, bringing foreign language backgrounds
with them. So there are all sorts of peculiar ways somebody
might say Hawaiian words. But everyone surely agrees there's
only one way to say Hawaiian words right and that's the true
Hawaiian way, of course. Anything else sounds like a false
note in the ears of those who know the difference. And with
the current increase of popular interest in Hawaiian culture,
there are growing numbers of people who do know the difference.
In fact, it has become a status symbol these days to be able
to write and say Hawaiian words with confidence as "somebody
who belongs here." There's really only one reason people are
unconcerned about preserving Hawaiian place names -- they just
can't be bothered. However, it's not difficult to learn the
correct usage of ONLY the particular Hawaiian terms which you
encounter frequently in the conduct your daily life. You'll
need to learn merely those FAMILIAR WORDS comprising your own
Personal Hawaiian Vocabulary. If we consider how often we see,
hear and say certain Hawaiian terms, it will be an easy matter
for anyone to compile a list of words which can be regarded as
immediate features of one's local environment. Thus, different
individuals will make different lists, according to their own
situation and the range of their activities. Start with ten
place names or street names —- and you're on your way!

 

PERSONAL HAWAIIAN VOCABULARY

 

WORD MEANING SOUND PATTERN

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

WHEN YOU NEED MORE LINES obtain a notebook and transfer your
first ten words into it. As your list becomes longer, it will
be helpful to begin organizing your Hawaiian terms into major
categories for quick reference, according to basic topics such
as Proper Names or Street Names or Town Names or Botanical Names
or Names Of Channels Between Islands, etc.

 

 

 

 

 

ALWAYS LOOK UP THE MEANING of any word you include. If there's
no literal translation, insert the notation: (meaning lost).

SOUND PATTERNS that first appeared in the 1965 publication
Instant Hawaiian Pocket Dictionary have been incorporated

into this program because these easy phonetic renderings

in English, indicating how to say a Hawaiian word right,

can be applied to any Hawaiian term. This is a valuable

aid to pronunciation which you'll be able to construct by
yourself after attending today's session. Each syllable

is shown as a unit of sound separated by dashes. Syllables
needing stress appear in CAPS while unstressed syllables are

in lower case. Keep watching how this is done so you can apply
helpful SOUND PATTERNS to your own Personal Hawaiian Vocabulary.
It's the key item for quick reference, indicating exactly how
to say a word -— without having to figure it out all over again!
