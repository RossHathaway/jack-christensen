## Kyoto Downpour 
A few upright rocks amidst plain gray pebbles, <br />
carefully selected to form a border surrounding <br />
the garden tea house, now gain surface details, <br />
previously unseen, when pelted by raindrops

and washed by silvery drippings from the eaves, <br />
while on a nearby side street, some children <br />
under umbrellas and wearing short rubber boots <br />
begin stamping and splashing through puddles, <br />
intently collecting random leaves, twigs and <br />
abandoned bits of litter which the youngsters <br />
drop into a flooding gutter, then race beside <br />
these pieces of rubbish that careen against

the concrete curb and gyrate away -- until <br />
the kids tire of this game and just stand, <br />
spinning their glistening umbrellas and <br />
gazing after the last traces of buoyant <br />
trash passing rapidly out of sight -- <br />
but across town a renowned museum keeps,

in a climate-controlled space behind glass, <br />
priceless examples of Japanese screens aglow <br />
with gold leaf and miniature scenes depicting <br />
traditional activities and historic events, <br />
all sorts of separate subjects and settings, <br />
each picture enclosed by dream-like clouds, <br />
painted in this classical manner by artists <br />
who keep changing their point of view!
