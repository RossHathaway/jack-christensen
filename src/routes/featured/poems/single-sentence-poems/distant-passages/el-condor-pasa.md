## El Condor Pasa 
At dawn in Arequipa our hired driver <br />
took us on a tiring high-altitude ride <br />
over horrendously rough, dusty roads <br />
until darkness fell as we reached a <br />
rustic hotel close to Colca Canyon <br />
where we went late the next morning

to the edge of a precipice, to watch <br />
the condors lift from cliffs and soar <br />
on supporting updrafts generated by <br />
sun-warmed air, when somebody said <br />
that a bold bird might come closer

if one of us went fifty paces away <br />
and played dead, so I volunteered <br />
to go lie down, facing upward and <br />
watching till a hungry condor did <br />
glide silently above me, gracefully <br />

circling near enough that I could see <br />
individual feathers outspread at its <br />
wing tips -- while my companions madly <br />
snapped pictures -- and when I returned <br />
home from this trip, I soon learned that <br />
a dear lady and a good friend had died, <br />
and checking my calendar, I discovered <br />
she had passed away on the day I played <br />
dead under the gloriously soaring condor.
