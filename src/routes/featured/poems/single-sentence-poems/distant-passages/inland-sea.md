## Inland Sea 
When leaving the quiet, pine clad islet <br />
where we'd rested overnight at an inn, <br />
we walked down the shoreline trail to <br />
a landing dock and waiting boat -­- <br />
glimpsed through the trees -- while <br />
averting our eyes from the sun just <br />
rising over the intensely sparkling <br />
surface of fragrant salt water, and <br />
we needed to be extra attentive on <br />
our way, so as not to be stepping <br />
inadvertently upon any of the many <br />
plump caterpillars crawling in their <br />
oddly humping manner across the path <br />
matted with dried tree needles and <br />
strewn with fallen cones, and then <br />
later that day, after entering the <br />
metropolitan center of Hiroshima, <br />

we came to a solemn standstill, <br />
facing a polished granite stone <br />
indicating Ground Zero where -­- <br />
with a fierce flash overhead -- <br />
­the fireball of an atomic bomb <br />

unleashed its lethal energies <br />
upon a civilian population.
