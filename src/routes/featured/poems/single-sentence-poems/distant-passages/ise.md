## Ise 
We stood among inquisitive, mystified people <br />
looking through the transparent silk curtain <br />
covering the entrance to the fenced enclosure, <br />
as near as you may peer at the inner precinct <br />
of Japan's highly venerated Geku Outer Shrine <br />
protected by four ranks of tall wooden walls, <br />
unpainted because no building in the successive <br />
courtyards is touched by preservatives, since <br />
all structures are replaced every twenty years, <br />
their cypress and cedar surfaces finished to

a velvet smoothness by expert craftsmen -- <br />
there being alternate sites, side by side, <br />
one in use and the other an empty expanse <br />
of marbled stones from a pristine river -- <br />
Â­and nobody enters either sanctified ground <br />
except Shinto priests, purified workers or <br />
exalted emissaries of The Imperial Family, <br />
although I saw a crow and some butterflies <br />
allowing themselves unrestricted access, <br />
and when I remarked on a cluster of weeds <br />
and fir sprouts growing out of a moist spot

on a gabled roof of reeds and thatched grass, <br />
our erudite guide replied, "Wild things are <br />
always honored here as natural ambassadors <br />
and divine messengers coming from the gods."
