## Global Hero 

Charles Lindbergh, an unknown aviator, <br />
was popularly labeled "Lucky Lindy" <br />
and "The Lone Eagle" in 1927 when at <br />
age twenty-five he became the first <br />
pilot to fly solo in a single-engine <br />
aircraft nonstop over the Atlantic, <br />
from New York to Paris in 33 hours

and 30 minutes, landing well after <br />
dark, to be greeted by an estimated <br />
throng of more than 50,000 Frenchmen <br />
mobbing the airport and lifting the <br />
American on their shoulders, carrying <br />
him to his new life as a world-famous <br />
personage, but that tumultuous public <br />
scene was not anything like the quiet <br />
setting of his death at seventy-two, <br />
on the opposite side of the planet, <br />
far out in the vast Pacific, at the <br />
peaceful eastern end of Maui Island <br />
where the terminally ill patient was <br />
staying in a modest cottage with his <br />
wife, writer Anne Morrow Lindbergh, <br />
because the attending doctor didn't <br />
have time for driving back and forth <br />
along the narrow, zigzag, coast road <br />
between his hospice in Hdna village

and the Lindbergh place at Kipahulu, <br />
a rock-walled house they built on a <br />
bluff overlooking the sea -- beyond <br />
some abandoned fields of banana trees <br />
which had become a wild, meandering <br />
jungle that people out there called <br />
The Banana River -- this picturesque <br />
property bartered from a friend who <br />
traded five acres of tropical terrain <br />
for a priceless collection of ethnic <br />
costumed dolls the intrepid flier had

acquired during his many international <br />
trips -- their residence located near <br />
the vacated little Palapala Ho'omau <br />
Hawaiian Church which they had helped <br />
restore, including the addition of a <br />
tall stained glass window across the <br />
space of an unused side door, a touch <br />
of colorful contemporary art for the <br />
otherwise austere rural chapel where <br />
Lindbergh said he wanted to be buried <br />
in the small adjoining cemetery, and <br />
so immediately after he died, he was <br />
lifted by a sturdy Polynesian into a <br />
plain wooden coffin handmade in liana <br />
from a sketch drawn by Lindbergh -Â­- and <br />
which local legend says may have

contained his leather helmet and the <br />
goggles worn throughout that historic <br />
transatlantic flight -- and then he <br />
was laid to rest, without a eulogy, <br />
as less than ten people witnessed

the casket lowered into the grave, <br />
and according to his last request, <br />
heavy lava boulders were piled into <br />
the pit, and finally the surface was

covered with smooth gray beach stones, <br />
in the Hawaiian Christian tradition, <br />
and afterward a rectangular slab with <br />
its memorial inscription was placed <br />
horizontally upon the site, as the <br />
inconspicuous marker for this always <br />
unassuming and reclusive celebrity.
