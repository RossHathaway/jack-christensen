## Uncouth Youth 
It's chilly midnight, not the best <br />
time to be standing alone on the <br />
westbound side of a highway where <br />
vehicles are seldom passing while <br />
I hitchhike homeward, so I take

a piddle out here in the middle <br />
of nowhere, then wait another <br />
hour before catching a ride <br />
through this widest stretch

in the State Of Texas -- <br />
Â­thumbing my way across the <br />
southland from Key West over <br />
to Los Angeles -- traveling <br />
with empty pockets in 1950 <br />
after a summer in Manhattan <br />
and New Jersey, then down

to Florida, thus finishing <br />
this last year of my teens <br />
with a final fling, expecting <br />
notification from Uncle Sam's <br />
Draft Board, saying it's about <br />
time for me to see more of the <br />
world -- possibly a group tour <br />
overseas to the Korean Peninsula.
