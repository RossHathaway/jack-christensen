## Spring Green 
I was invited to meet the master <br />
architect Frank Lloyd Wright for <br />
a private conversation at his <br />
remote farmstead residence on

a hillside near Spring Green in <br />
southwestern Wisconsin -- this <br />
appointment arranged by mailing <br />
to him a letter of introduction <br />
from a former secretary of his -- <br />
and the date granted was Tuesday,

June 8th, 1954 that happened to be <br />
Wright's eighty-seventh birthday, <br />
when I was in my twenty-third year, <br />
but during the first minutes of our <br />
time together, it seemed to me the <br />
six decades that separated our ages <br />
miraculously disappeared from the <br />
room of local timber and limestone, <br />
uniquely designed and harmoniously <br />
decorated, where I had been taken <br />
to await Mr. Wright who presently <br />
entered, immaculately dressed and

smiling and cordially asking, "Well, <br />
young man, just what is it you need <br />
to be talking with me about?" and so <br />
we sat and I told him of my upcoming

discharge from military service and <br />
my present indecision about pursuing <br />
higher education, and then he rested <br />
both hands on the knob of his cane <br />
and said, "Colleges are in business <br />
selling diplomas as endorsements of <br />
a student's long preparation for a <br />
certain kind of career, and this <br />
pigeonholes many individuals who

are more imaginative and creative <br />
and possess a poetic temperament <br />
that naturally resists being laced <br />
into an academic straitjacket, but <br />
you can skip a cap-and-gown degree <br />
and instead just buy the classes <br />
you think might offer guidelines <br />
for developing your own personal <br />
interpretation of life, and then <br />
you can proceed as we do in my <br />
field of architecture, learning <br />
the basics of your chosen work, <br />
such as the laborious mixing of <br />
earthen slush with straw, and <br />
molding this into bricks needed <br />
for building some kind of plan, <br />
from a mud hut, up to a towering <br />
cathedral," and although I later

found out that this brick-making <br />
metaphor was the favorite advice <br />
Mr. Wright often gave to admirers <br />
arriving at his door -- no matter <br />
what their line of endeavor -- I <br />
decided to follow his suggestion, <br />
also keeping a clear recollection <br />
of that grand old man pointing the <br />
handle of his cane to indicate a <br />
solitary painting hung high on

a nearby wall -- the portrait of <br />
a stately matron -- and saying, <br />
"America still needs pioneers, <br />
like my mother there, as our <br />
nation continues to enter all <br />
sorts of newfound frontiers <br />
that challenge individuals <br />
to rise above the commonplace <br />
and become uncommon, which in <br />
this democracy is actually our <br />
Constitutional Right" and then <br />
he stood and extended to me a <br />
firm hand of the irrepressible <br />
builder-thinker-radical-patriot

who showed people the world over <br />
how to cultivate the supreme art <br />
of living in accord with Nature.
