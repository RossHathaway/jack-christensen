Jack Shields Christensen, "Uncle Jack", suddenly passed away on May 7, 2018 at the age of 87. For creative purposes over the years he was also legally known as: Chris Christensen, Scott Burlington, and Reverend "Revi" Fiercely. He was fully active to his last day.

This website is a compilation of Jack’s writings on his many life interests and projects and is an offering to anyone who might share these interests. Jack felt that everyone should take the time to explore their fascinations fully and to share their life’s story. This statement by Erwin Schrodinger inspired him to document his own reflections:

"If you cannot -- in the long run -- tell everyone what you have been doing, your doing has been worthless."
