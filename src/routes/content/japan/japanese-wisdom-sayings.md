PRESERVED IN FOLKLORE worldwide there are many profound and humorous sayings which provide guidelines for humankind -­regardless of geographic and cultural boundaries. Familiar proverbs repeated in any nation reveal the true values of its people. Numerous Japanese sayings refer to old age, reflecting a tradition of recognizing elderly persons as repositories of experience and judgment. Also venerable objects -- from family heirlooms, to practical tools that indicate long periods of service -- receive great respect and are still revered after their time has passed.
