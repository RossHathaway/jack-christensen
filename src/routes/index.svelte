    This website is a compilation of Jack’s writings on his many life interests
    and projects and is an offering to anyone who might share these interests.
    Jack felt that everyone should take the time to explore their fascinations
    fully and to share their life’s story. This statement by Erwin Schrodinger
    inspired him to document his own reflections:

    "If you cannot -- in the long run -- tell everyone what you have been doing,
    your doing has been worthless."
