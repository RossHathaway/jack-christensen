<h2>ABOUT UNCLE JACK</h2> 

<p markdown="1"><strong>THREE TOURS</strong> are conducted free of charge during the first week of every month by yours truly, "Uncle Jack" Christensen. These activities evolved from two Public Service Projects that I co-founded many years ago with Robert Boom -Â­ <strong>The Program To Preserve Hawaiian Place Names</strong> in 1974 and <strong>The Clean Air Team</strong> in 1975 -- the latter being the first organization formed in The Islands to advocate legislative control of environmental tobacco smoke.

Both groups no longer have an active membership, except for a very few loyal volunteers who occasionally assist me as I continue to keep some well established activities going as long as possible. I'm the sole financial sponsor -- certainly not because I'm rich, but because the basic operating expenses remain low. Thus, people attending any of these free events are never asked to give financial contributions.

<strong>
JUST FOR THE RECORD:
</strong> 
My full name is Jack Shields Christensen and I was born in Wisconsin. I grew up in Southern California and came to Honolulu in 1956, enrolling at the University Of Hawai'i as a sophomore transfer student from San Diego State College and the University Of Alabama. I kept attending classes at UH, off and on, until age 85 in 2016. However, I've never acquired an advanced academic standing in the conventional sense or pursued a professional career. Instead, my "scholarship" has been devoted to cultivating various special interests. 
</p> <p> 
<strong> AGE SEVENTY-ONE,</strong> I began to learn something completely new for me, practicing springboard and high platform diving with two coaches and members of the UH Precision Diving Team. Now I've become the oldest person in the 50th State who continues to perform dives from Olympic tower platforms, supervised by coaches on a regular schedule.
