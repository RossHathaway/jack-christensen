**JUST FOR THE RECORD:** 
My full name is Jack Shields Christensen and I was born in Wisconsin. I grew up in Southern California and came to Honolulu in 1956, enrolling at the University Of Hawai'i as a sophomore transfer student from San Diego State College and the University Of Alabama. I kept attending classes at UH, off and on, until age 85 in 2016. However, I've never acquired an advanced academic standing in the conventional sense or pursued a professional career. Instead, my "scholarship" has been devoted to cultivating various special interests. 

**AGE SEVENTY-ONE,** I began to learn something completely new for me, practicing springboard and high platform diving with two coaches and members of the UH Precision Diving Team. Now I've become the oldest person in the 50th State who continues to perform dives from Olympic tower platforms, supervised by coaches on a regular schedule.
