## Jack Shields Christensen – Personal Religious Symbol

      **Jack Shields Christensen**
      (1931-2018) first developed this symbol of belief in the mid-1970’s and
      used it continually since. It derived from his studies of Taoism and the
      writings of Lao Tzu. Using the translation from Chinese by Witter Bynner, *The Way of Live According to Lao Tzu, an American Version*, 1944, the symbol is his personal visual representation of Verse 58,
      lines 12-15 (page 62 of the Capricorn Books Edition, 1962).

        “... a sound man shall so
        <span class="reverse-color">square the circle</span>
        <br />
        <span class="reverse-color">And circle the square</span>
        as not to injure, not to impede:
        <br />
        The glow of his life shall not daze,
        <br />
        It shall lead.”

      And in his *Earthling: My Long Journey toward Spiritual Maturity, Part One: Elevation Of Consciousness*, in the section named Longhand Affirmations, Jack Shields Christensen
      wrote:

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Along your way to the high plateau of old age,
        <span class="reverse-color">
          you are always confined within the circle of your consciousness and
          the square of your Quadratic Balance.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Quadratic Balance is our cultivated awareness of the four components of
        humankind – physical, emotional, rational, spiritual – which comprise
        our evolutionary fore-nature that we must respect conscientiously if we
        are to advance in accord with The True Human Movement.”
