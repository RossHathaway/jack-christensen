## THREE FREE ACTIVITIES DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF EVERY MONTH

<EndedIn2018 />

FIRST FRIDAY: **"Chant Walking Can Help You"** 2:00 PM Learn how to practice Chant Walking right in the hectic center of the city. A special route is followed through selected sites that create an inspirational environment which produces an immediate feeling of well-being. The leader advocates deep breathing, natural body carriage and the psychological benefit of personal autosuggestion. Starts on the public sidewalk alongside the fountain in front of Saint Andrew's Cathedral on Beretania Street.

FIRST SATURDAY: **"Hike To Diamond Head Lighthouse"** 2:00 PM Enjoy a pleasant outing in one of the most beautiful parts of Honolulu. This event originated as The Diamond Head Hike in 1982 and now ranks as the Aloha State's oldest, regularly scheduled, all-volunteer Litter Control Project. The group passes through the entire length of scenic Kapi'olani Park, then goes beyond The Gold Coast residential district and uphill a short way to the 55-foot tower which we do not enter. Meet the leader at the bare feet of the Mahatma Gandhi Statue near the entrance to Honolulu Zoo.

FIRST SUNDAY: **"Strolling With A Longevity Coach"** 2:00 PM Starts at the replica of the Liberty Bell in front of the State Capitol. It's Uncle Jack's newest tour, and for this one he wears a sports whistle on a cord around his neck as a wary whistle-blower against The American Suicide Diet. He encourages people to aim toward __a productive longevity__ (not merely "life extension") by first attaining freedom from old, worn out, life shortening, eating habits â€” replacing them with better dietary selections that gradually wean us from consuming popular but debilitating "food substitutes" and today's "factory fare" processed and packaged by machinery.
