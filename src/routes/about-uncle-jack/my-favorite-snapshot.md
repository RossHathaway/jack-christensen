<strong>MY FAVORITE SNAPSHOT</strong> was taken by Professor Winfield E. Nagley
who later became chairman of the Philosophy Department at the
University Of Hawai'i. I'm in my mid—twenties atop a phallic
rock at the Hawaiian cultural site of Ka-ule-o—Nanahoa located
approximately 1,500 feet above sea level on the world's highest
ocean cliff, Moloka'i Island. Legend says this spot is where

a man named Nanahoa and his wife Kawahuna were turned into stone.
It was also believed that if a woman placed offerings and spent
the night here, she'd return home pregnant. Phallic rocks are
found as fertility symbols on all the Hawaiian Islands, and this
is the finest example. The natural configuration of the stone
was carved to some extent by ancient people.
